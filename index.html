		<p>Photography is a hobby of mine, but there was never time to learn how photoshop works with a busy life. Even though I knew some of the 		essential functions of photoshop, this course was a bit challenging. I am glad that this course is a requirement for my degree because 		it gave me more tools to modify images that I love. I will no longer need to pay someone else to fix them. The course itself was easy 		to understand, and the learning material provided was terrific.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>I truly enjoyed this course! The weekly activities were fun because it allowed for feedback from our peers. I also enjoyed seeing what 		others created. This course was also the less stressful of the semester. The instructions provided for each lab were clear and easy to 		understand. The feedback provided with each lab gave me the motivation to do better in the next lab. The practice videos provided were 		also beneficial and easy to follow. I enjoyed everything about this course.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p> This course motivated me to continue to learn about everything Photoshop has to offer as as as Creative Cloud. I look forward to 			applying everything that I have learned this semester to future projects. This course pushed my creativity and taught me so much!
            I can not wait to continue to fix many of the pictures on my camera. I also look forward
            in exploring how the techniques that I have learned will help me in my future career.
            The six images that I picked for this lab are unique to the most challenging ones or me. I created a navigation bar for you to explore my work. For SURE lab 4 part c, it is my was and is still my FAVORITE project. I hope you enjoy it!!
			<br>
			Thank you!
